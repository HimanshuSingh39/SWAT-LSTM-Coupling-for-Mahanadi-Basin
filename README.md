# SWAT-LSTM-Coupling-for-Mahanadi-Basin
This repository contains code, data structure, and results for coupling the SWAT hydrological model with an LSTM neural network to improve daily streamflow simulation in the Mahanadi River Basin, India. By training LSTM on SWAT residuals, the hybrid model significantly improves prediction accuracy.
